package PVE::LXC::Setup::Plugin;

# The abstract Plugin interface which user should restrict themself too.
#
# There are two main implementations of this interface:
# - Base: This is the base for all "normal" Linux system distros, where PVE tries to manage all
#   basic environment aspects (like network related configs, hostname). If something fails there,
#   the error should be relayed to the caller.
# - Unmanaged: this avoids doing as much as possible, assuming that the CT and it's enviroment gets
#   managed through other means (from manually or some other init or configuration stack). Due to
#   that, we should try to avoid erroring out but rather returning safe defaults or undef where we
#   cannot determine something. The calling code then needs to be able to handle this explicitly,
#   sometimes by having a dedicated check for the CT being of type "unmanaged".
